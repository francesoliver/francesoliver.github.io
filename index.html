      <h3>IN A NUTSHELL</h3>

      <p>
        Frances hails from Connecticut and went to school in Chicago, where she studied Arts Management and Entrepreneurship at Columbia College and honed in on her operational skills through years in office management and event planning. Never the one to like being placed in a box, she sought out a new kind of role when her husband took a job in Charleston in 2015. Landing a position as head of product development at Sideshow Press, it gave her the opportunity to combine her love and talent for artistic endeavours with her business background.

        Outside of work, Frances spends time restoring her 1930’s home, perusing the antique stores for rare costume jewelry, cooking, and dreaming of owning a sailboat one day.
